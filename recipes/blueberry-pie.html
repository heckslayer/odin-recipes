    <h2>Blueberry Pie Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated blueberry pie recipe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar: This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.</li>
        <li>Cornstarch: Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing runniness.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
        <li>Blueberries: Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't find fresh, frozen (and thawed) will taste mighty fine too.</li>
        <li>Pie crust: Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</li>
        <li>Butter: You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</li>
    </ul>
